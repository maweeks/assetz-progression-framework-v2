Our frameworks are built around 6 principles, those principles are:

- 💬 Transparency
- ✅ Quality
- 📊 Data-driven
- 👪 Respect for team
- ♻️ Continuous Improvement
- 🚀 Role-specific Excellence

Transparency, Quality, Data-driven, Respect for team, and Continuous Improvement will all be shared between each of the frameworks with the intention that these are filled with behaviours that we would expect from colleagues. Role-specific Excellence will be much more focused on behaviors that show that you do your role brilliantly, for example Engineering Excellence.
