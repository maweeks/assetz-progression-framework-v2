Our frameworks are build around 6 principles that we hope will help make Assetz a great place to work!

Those principles are:

- 💬 Transparency
- ✅ Quality
- 📊 Data-driven
- 👪 Respect for team
- ♻️ Continuous Improvement
- 🚀 Role-specific Excellence

Transparency, Quality, Data-driven, Respect for team, and Continuous Improvement will all be shared between each of the frameworks with the intention that these are filled with behaviours that we would expect from colleagues company. Role-specific Excellence will be much more focussed on behaviors that show that you do your role brilliantly, for example Engineering Excellence.
