The competency levels cover your soft skills, and these are broken down into 4 main areas:

- Communication
- Influence
- Impact
- Leadership

Whatever your level of expertise within your Specialism, you‚Äôll only be able to progress if you‚Äôre also achieving the same Competency level, e.g. if you‚Äôre technically ready to progress onto Engineer level 3, you‚Äôll also need to be nailing your influence in retros and feeding back to your peers.

Competency levels span across all Specialisms - technical and non-technical - and really give you an idea of the behaviours we expect from our teammates and the culture we operate in.

These skills can‚Äôt be learnt from a book, but come from confidence and comfort within your team and show that you‚Äôre here every day to help your team thrive.
