It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ECS (Elastic Container Service)</td>\n<td>AWS ECS is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale containerized applications on AWS.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ElastiCache</td>\n<td>AWS ElastiCache offers fully managed Redis and Memcached. Seamlessly deploy, run, and scale popular open source compatible in-memory data stores.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fargate</td>\n<td>AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RDS (Relational Database Service)</td>\n<td>AWS RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>S3 (Simple Storage Service)</td>\n<td>AWS S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</td>\n<td>AWS VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WAF (Web Application Firewall)</td>\n<td>AWS WAF helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over which traffic to allow or block to your web applications by defining customizable web security rules.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"path":"/frameworks/devOps","title":"‚ôæÔ∏è DevOps Framework","sidebarTitle":"‚ôæÔ∏è
